# Local build

To build and package extension to a zip file:

```
make
```

To deploy the layer as a new version:

```
make add-layer-version PROFILE=integrations REGIONS=us-east-1 LAYER_NAME=signalfx-extension-wrapper CI=t
```

To make the layer globally available (example for us-east-1 only):

```
make add-layer-version-permission PROFILE=integrations REGIONS=us-east-1 LAYER_NAME=signalfx-extension-wrapper CI=t
```

Variables explanation:
* PROFILE - the name of the [AWS CLI profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) - indicates the AWS account where the layer will be published
* REGIONS - a space-delimited list of regions where the layer will be published
* LAYER_NAME - the name of the layer

The published layer can be attached to any AWS Lambda function, regardless of a runtime.


### Deploy to a specified set of regions (example)

```
make all add-layer-version add-layer-version-permission PROFILE=rnd REGIONS="us-east-1 ap-northeast-1" CI=t
```

# CircleCI

### Overview

This project is ready to run with CircleCI environment.
The CircleCI workflow configured in [config.yml](.circleci/config.yml) consists of:
* continuous integration capabilities (run on every branch)
    * unit test
    * package the extension as a Lambda Layer (an artifact deployable to AWS Lambda)
* continuous delivery capabilities (run on the `master` branch;
   branches with the `pipeline-` prefix run e2e tests)
    * publish a new version of the layer to all available regions
    * test the layer in the selected set of regions
        * create a lambda function (with the layer attached)
        * invoke the function a couple of times
        * remove the function
        * using SignalFlow client, verify that Splunk Observability backend received all expected datapoints
    * make the published versions publicly available (this step runs only on the `master` branch,
      and it has to be manually approved)

### Set up

While the CI part can work right out of the box, the CD part requires a few setup steps.
This includes:

* For releasing
    * Create an AWS account which will be used for layer publishing.
      It must have the following permissions:
        ```json
        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                    "Resource": "*"
                },
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": [
                        "lambda:PublishLayerVersion"
                    ],
                    "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:*:<account_number>:layer:signalfx-extension-wrapper"
                },
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": [
                        "lambda:AddLayerVersionPermission"
                    ],
                    "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:*:<account_number>:layer:signalfx-extension-wrapper:*"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

    * Note: publishing user and testing user are not separated yet, for now add 
      the above permissions for the testing user that will be set up in the next step.

* End-to-end testing
    * Create a basic role for a function (call it `signalfx-extension-wrapper-testing`)
        ```json
        {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Principal": {
                "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"
              },
              "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
      
    * Create an AWS account which will be used for testing. 
      It must have the following permissions:
        ```json
        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": [
                        "lambda:CreateFunction",
                        "lambda:InvokeFunction",
                        "lambda:DeleteFunction"
                    ],
                    "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:*:<account_number>:function:singalfx-extension-wrapper-test-function"
                },
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": [
                        "lambda:PublishLayerVersion",
                        "lambda:GetLayerVersion",
                        "lambda:AddLayerVersionPermission",
                        "lambda:DeleteLayerVersion"
                    ],
                    "Resource": [
                        "arn:aws:lambda:*:<account_number>:layer:signalfx-extension-wrapper-test",
                        "arn:aws:lambda:*:<account_number>:layer:signalfx-extension-wrapper-test:*"
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": [
                        "iam:PassRole"
                    ],
                    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::<account_number>:role/signalfx-extension-wrapper-testing"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

    * Set up a CircleCI context called `aws-integrations-lambda-extension-user`.
      Set there the following environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, 
      `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, so they point to the account setup in the previous step.
      
    * Set up a CircleCI context called `eu0-integrations-ingest`.
      Set there the following environment variables: `INGEST_REALM`, `INGEST_TOKEN`,
      so they point to a Splunk ingest.

* Environment variables
    * Required
        * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - the id of the access key for the AWS account where the layer will be tested and published
        * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - the secret for the access key (the one defined above)
        * `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` - actually it doesn't matter which region, but it is required
        * `INGEST_REALM` - realm to which data points will be published (testing)
        * `INGEST_TOKEN` - access token of an organization to which data points will be published (testing)
        * `PROFILE` - should be set to 'default'
