# Splunk Extension for AWS Lambda

The Splunk Extension for AWS Lambda provides customers with a simplified runtime-independent
interface to collect high-resolution, low-latency metrics on AWS Lambda function execution.

The Splunk Extension layer tracks metrics for cold start, invocation count, function lifetime, and termination
condition. This enables customers to effectively monitor their AWS Lambda Functions with
minimal overhead.

For official documentation on the metrics collected by the Splunk OpenTelemetry Lambda Layer 
and how to configure ingest modes,
